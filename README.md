# Projects

This is an umbrella repository for multiple projects. It currently consists these projects:

- [BLDEV](https://github.com/normvcr/BLDEV): C++ build environment, plus IO source code generation (persistance)
- [NoClick](https://github.com/normvcr/NoClick): Mouse clicking & dragging, without physical mouse clicking

You may download this entire repository, or refer to the page of the project you are interested in, for how to obtain just the source code for that project.  As other projects are added, they may be added to existing code you may have cloned, as the projects are all part of this umbrella repository -- common code between projects need not be replicated.
